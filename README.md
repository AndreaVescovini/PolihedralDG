# PolyhedralDG
PACS-ANEDP Project by Andrea Vescovini

This repository contains the codes of the project for the courses of Andvanced programming for scientific computing (PACS) and
Numerical analysis for partial differential equations (ANEDP). The aim of the project is the implementation of **Discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) methods for elliptic problems on polyhedral grids**.

## Content
* In the folder `DG_code` there is the code for the PACS project, i.e. a C++ library called PolyDG and some examples.
* In the folder `Matlab` there is an unmantained Matlab code written in the first development phase, it implements a DG method for
  solving the Poisson problem over tetrahedral meshes.
* In the folder `Matlab_poly` there is the code for the ANEDP project, it implements a DG method for solving the Poisson problem
  over polyhedral meshes.
* In the folder `Report` there are the reports and the slides.
* In the folder `meshes` there are some meshes used to test the codes.
