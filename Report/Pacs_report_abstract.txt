The main goal of this project is to implement a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
finite element method for solving a three-dimensional elliptic problems
employing a general polyhedral mesh. With this purpose a C++ library has been
developed, employing the technique of expression templates in order to assemble
the linear system.
Discontinuous Galerkin methods have shown to be very flexible and have been
successfully applied to hyperbolic, elliptic and parabolic problems arising from
many different fields of application.
Moreover one of the main advantages with respect to the continuous framework is
the possibility of handling meshes with hanging nodes and made of general-shaped
elements without any difficulty. Meshes made of general polyhedral elements can
be useful in many problems, especially when we have to deal with domains that
present small details or microstructures; these features would need too many
"classical" tetrahedral/hexahedral elements to be described and so too many
degrees of freedom.
In Section 1 we recall the main results about standard DG methods, then in
Subsection 1.8 we develop the theory in order to handle polyhedral grids.
Afterwards in Section 2 we explain our choices for the implementation of the
algorithm, is Section 3 we highlight how the C++ library works and eventually in Section 4 
we present some numerical results conforming to the theoretical estimates.
